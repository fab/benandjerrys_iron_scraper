Ben & Jerry's Iron.io Scraper
=============================
This web scraper uses [iron.io](http://iron.io) to generate a database of store locations for [Ben & Jerry's](http://www.benjerry.com) ice cream flavors. There is also a scraper that obtains detailed information about each of the flavours. Together, these two scrapers provide the data for the [Ben & Jerry's API](https://github.com/fab/benandjerrys_api).

The Iron.io scraper is based on the original [Ben & Jerry's scraper](https://github.com/fab/benandjerrys_scraper).
